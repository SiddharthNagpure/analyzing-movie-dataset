### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement**

Our aim in this project is to explore the movie dataset and find some movies with high ratings. Our friend has just begun with his vacations and wants us to suggest some good movies for him to watch.

Since we have just learned Python, we decided to use our Python skills to analyze a movie dataset and explore the ratings of the movies. In our dataset, we have the details of the movies in more than 50 languages, but our friend is interested only in watching English movies. Thus, our goal is to analyze the data and suggest English movies with high-ratings to our friend.
